This repository contains a reverse shell for Windows. The client is written in C
and the server is written in Python. The reverse shell communicates using HTTP
and has the ability to execute commands, upload and download files and read and
write to the Windows registry. It has a hardcoded password. This was created
using Visual Studio.

The code is licensed under the AGPL v3 or (at your option) any later version.
